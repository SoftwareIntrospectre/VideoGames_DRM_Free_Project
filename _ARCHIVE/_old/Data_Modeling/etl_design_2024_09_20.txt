- ingest files into a staging environment
- store 


My plan is to ingest a CSV to a SQL staging table on a daily schedule as-is, 
then move data to other dimensional modeled tables, where I will do the de-duplication in SQL.

The daily file will be 10,000 rows, and every day the staging table will grow by 10,000 rows. 

The idea is to have a historical record of the raw data, then stage each load via stored procedures, 
then deduplicate records in the dimensional modeled fact and dimension tables.




Advantages of This Approach

    Historical Record:
        Keeping a raw version of the data in a staging table allows you to maintain a full historical record, which can be invaluable for audits, analysis, and debugging.

    Separation of Concerns:
        By separating the ingestion process from the transformation and loading into dimensional tables, you create a clear workflow that enhances maintainability and readability.

    Efficiency:
        SQL is optimized for set-based operations, making it generally faster for deduplication tasks, especially as your data volume grows.

    Simplified ETL Process:
        Using stored procedures to manage the transition from the staging table to the dimensional tables allows for cleaner and more organized code, which can be easier to manage and update.

    Scalability:
        With a consistent daily load of 10,000 rows, your approach can scale well. SQL databases can handle this volume without issues, and your method keeps the data organized.

Considerations

    Indexing:
        Ensure that you have appropriate indexing on your staging and dimensional tables to improve performance, especially during the deduplication process.

    Handling Duplicates:
        Define clear rules for deduplication. Make sure your SQL queries are designed to effectively identify and manage duplicates based on your business logic.

    Error Handling:
        Implement error handling and logging in your ETL process to catch any issues during the data load or transformation phases.

    Performance Monitoring:
        As your dataset grows, keep an eye on performance. Periodically review your SQL queries and staging processes to optimize as needed.
