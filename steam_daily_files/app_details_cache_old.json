Equipped with her dual revolvers and the sun necklace gifted in her mother's final moments, Grace is determined to find out what took her mother. <br><br>Use your run and gun-style skills to navigate the treacherous abyss and rid Dululth of its monsters! The abyss features tons of items that drastically impact the way the game is played and will aid in the increased difficulty per level. Using random generation, each level of the abyss is unique and rewards different styles of play. Whispering Abyss also features collectible journal entries that help Grace uncover the mystery of what happened all those years ago.

These eyes like to hunt in packs to overwhelm their prey rather than take it on alone. You should have nothing to worry about if facing one of these creatures, but be careful and don\u2019t dawdle on taking them out because they can very quickly become a problem. Take your gaze off a wandering eye, and the next time you spot it, you\u2019ll have way more than one to worry about. Standing and fighting a horde is a death sentence find a way to thin it out or take them out in bottleneck areas.<br><br><strong>Tendrils</strong><br>The other half of a deadly pair and a common occurrence is the tendrils in the Abyss. Like the wandering eyes, these tendrils are weak, especially alone, but the danger lies in their ability to corner you. These tendrils occupy valuable space and rely on their friends to push you towards them for the kill. The easiest way to deal with a tendril is by being aware of your surroundings so as not to get pushed into their range. Tendrils cannot move horizontally, only lunge, and using this against them is paramount to your survival down there. Do not underestimate them or suffer the consequences.<br><br><strong>The Forgotten</strong><br>Once humans just like you, the forgotten are special because they\u2019re the only monsters that can hit you from range. They want your attention elsewhere, so they get a perfect shot at you with the massive rocks they hurl. The forgotten have buried themselves in the ground, rooting themselves for greater durability and the ability to attack from range. Use this against them, as long as you keep moving, they won\u2019t be able to target you accurately. Don\u2019t ever double back against a forgotten, or you\u2019ll find yourself waking up at the pearly gates a bit too soon. If you\u2019re fast enough, you can get away with leaving them for last, but be warned, these creatures will take any chance to strike you with a lightning-quick boulder to the head.<br><br><strong>The Stalker</strong><br>Stalkers like to watch their targets, then charge up a dash attack that only matches its power in speed. They say if you listen close enough, you can hear the huffs of a stalker tracking you at some points in the Abyss.

        "about_the_game": "<strong>WELCOME TO DULUTH.</strong><br><br>After watching her mother get dragged underneath the surface by something terrible, a young Grace Havenshroud was left scared and alone. 10 years later, Grace returns to her hometown of Duluth, Minnesota. Equipped with her dual revolvers and the sun necklace gifted in her mother's final moments, Grace is determined to find out what took her mother. <br><br>Use your run and gun-style skills to navigate the treacherous abyss and rid Dululth of its monsters! The abyss features tons of items that drastically impact the way the game is played and will aid in the increased difficulty per level. Using random generation, each level of the abyss is unique and rewards different styles of play. Whispering Abyss also features collectible journal entries that help Grace uncover the mystery of what happened all those years ago. Will Grace discover Duluth\u2019s secrets, or will she meet the same fate as her mother?<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2080930/extras/graceanim.gif?t=1666983670\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Lore-enriched gameplay shown through unlockable journal pages, secret lore bits, and much more.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Exotic items that drastically change the way the game is played.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Randomly generated levels that make each run new and exciting!</strong><br></li><li><strong>Beautiful environments and distinct enemies with special attack patterns!</strong><br></li><li><strong>Enemies, items, and special NPCs inspired by Lovecraftian lore!</strong></li></ul><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2080930/extras/enenenemiesanibig.gif?t=1666983670\" /><br><br><strong>Traveler\u2019s guide to the Whispering Abyss</strong><br><br><strong>The Wandering Eyes</strong><br>Half of a deadly pair and one of the more common enemies found in the Abyss. These eyes like to hunt in packs to overwhelm their prey rather than take it on alone. You should have nothing to worry about if facing one of these creatures, but be careful and don\u2019t dawdle on taking them out because they can very quickly become a problem. Take your gaze off a wandering eye, and the next time you spot it, you\u2019ll have way more than one to worry about. Standing and fighting a horde is a death sentence find a way to thin it out or take them out in bottleneck areas.<br><br><strong>Tendrils</strong><br>The other half of a deadly pair and a common occurrence is the tendrils in the Abyss. Like the wandering eyes, these tendrils are weak, especially alone, but the danger lies in their ability to corner you. These tendrils occupy valuable space and rely on their friends to push you towards them for the kill. The easiest way to deal with a tendril is by being aware of your surroundings so as not to get pushed into their range. Tendrils cannot move horizontally, only lunge, and using this against them is paramount to your survival down there. Do not underestimate them or suffer the consequences.<br><br><strong>The Forgotten</strong><br>Once humans just like you, the forgotten are special because they\u2019re the only monsters that can hit you from range. They want your attention elsewhere, so they get a perfect shot at you with the massive rocks they hurl. The forgotten have buried themselves in the ground, rooting themselves for greater durability and the ability to attack from range. Use this against them, as long as you keep moving, they won\u2019t be able to target you accurately. Don\u2019t ever double back against a forgotten, or you\u2019ll find yourself waking up at the pearly gates a bit too soon. If you\u2019re fast enough, you can get away with leaving them for last, but be warned, these creatures will take any chance to strike you with a lightning-quick boulder to the head.<br><br><strong>The Stalker</strong><br>Stalkers like to watch their targets, then charge up a dash attack that only matches its power in speed. They say if you listen close enough, you can hear the huffs of a stalker tracking you at some points in the Abyss. Their tough hide makes them harder to take down than most enemies but not impossible and if it bleeds, it dies; remember that. Stay light on your feet, traveler, and never stay in the same place too long lest you want to feel the fate of the many unfortunate victims before you.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2080930/extras/loootanimt.gif?t=1666983670\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Ritual</strong> Consumes hp, enter a very strong berserk mode, increased dmg, speed, fire rate.<br><i>Picking up this item consumes some of the user\u2019s hp to enter a beserked state, granting her increased dmg, speed, and fire rate.<br>\u201cJust because I use some of their enchantments doesn\u2019t make me comparable to them.\u201d<br>\u201cThis is a necessary evil.

A crazy week on a gorgeous tropical island, in a magnificent beach resort, with a luxurious private apartment all to yourselves! But, as in the worst stories, your two friends ruin everything, and you are left alone.... What to do? Stay home amid regrets?
