But survival isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. The anomalies you face grow more frequent and terrifying with each passing day. To protect yourself, you must actively switch between cameras, observe every inch of the warehouse, and when necessary, shut off cameras to make these anomalies vanish\u2014if only for a short while.

Every sound will feel like a threat, and every image on the camera will make you question reality.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you battle the isolation and fear, you\u2019ll notice how quickly things spiral out of control. What starts as subtle changes\u2014a misplaced object or a flicker of light\u2014soon becomes outright terror. By the end of the week, the warehouse is a living nightmare, filled with horrifying anomalies that threaten your very sanity.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Can you keep your composure and <strong>survive until dawn</strong>, or will the warehouse\u2019s sinister forces claim you as their next victim? Prepare for an intense, immersive experience where every decision counts, and your only defense is your wits and the cameras that separate you from the terror that lurks in the dark.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is not just a horror game, it\u2019s a <strong>test of endurance</strong>, as the line between reality and nightmare blurs more and more each night.

The once quiet space now holds inexplicable phenomena that <strong>slowly escalate in terror with each passing night</strong>.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Your mission is simple: survive the night shifts for one week. But survival isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. The anomalies you face grow more frequent and terrifying with each passing day. To protect yourself, you must actively switch between cameras, observe every inch of the warehouse, and when necessary, shut off cameras to make these anomalies vanish\u2014if only for a short while. But beware, missing too many anomalies could spell your doom.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3276980/extras/warehouse.gif?t=1729556216\" /></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Each night brings new horrors that <strong>keep you on edge</strong>, testing your ability to stay calm under pressure. The warehouse may look ordinary, but as soon as you enter the night shift, you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s anything but. Every sound will feel like a threat, and every image on the camera will make you question reality.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">As you battle the isolation and fear, you\u2019ll notice how quickly things spiral out of control. What starts as subtle changes\u2014a misplaced object or a flicker of light\u2014soon becomes outright terror. By the end of the week, the warehouse is a living nightmare, filled with horrifying anomalies that threaten your very sanity.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Can you keep your composure and <strong>survive until dawn</strong>, or will the warehouse\u2019s sinister forces claim you as their next victim? Prepare for an intense, immersive experience where every decision counts, and your only defense is your wits and the cameras that separate you from the terror that lurks in the dark.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This is not just a horror game, it\u2019s a <strong>test of endurance</strong>, as the line between reality and nightmare blurs more and more each night. Will you make it through the week? Or will the horrors lurking in the warehouse be too much to bear?</p>",

        "detailed_description": "You are about to defend our energy planet from enemy orbs. Use the cursor keys to fire lasers into the orbs that appear on the screen. The ones coming from above use the up key, from below, the down key. Only use the left and right keys for orbs that are moving side to side, from the left and from the right. In the easy and normal levels, you can shoot at any time. On the hard level, you have to wait until the cross icon disappears from the orb before shooting. Also in the hard level, if you try to shoot an orb with the cross or into a direction that has no orb, you will be blocked from using the laser for a few seconds. Until the window flashes blue and a &quot;released&quot; message sounds. Also, from time to time a special type of weapon is used to destroy the planet. A big target type icon will appear and you must press X in your keyboard. In the normal and hard levels, you need to wait until the icon scales down and blinks inside the planet before you can press the key. You have a total of 4 levels per difficulty and on each level, you will receive a full shield and a set of bombs that can be used with the space bar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the harder levels, the bombs also unlock the laser when blocked. To get higher scores, try to destroy orbs in a series to get combos that will multiply as you hit more and more orbs during a short period of time. Another way to get more points is to shoot orbs near the energy planet to get double or a million points. Also, there are 4 Play Modes. Mode A is the regular one, with just red orbs. Mode B has red and blue orbs and you must use the second set of keys to shoot the blue orbs and the regular keys for the red orbs. On Mode C you will have red, green and blue orbs. The secondary set of keys will select which colour you can shoot. The HUD colour will change to the one that you can target. Check the Options-Input settings to see and change key or buttons configurations. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave Fun!",

With over a dozen defensives, there are many build strategies to explore.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your crew</h2> - Your crew is armed with enthusiasm and a bunch of weapons (assuming you have been looting), but not much intelligence. Issue commands to individuals or the group as a whole, then hope they know how to follow instructions. It's up to you to tell them when to search, what to build, how to fight, and more. Or else they'll all die horribly violent deaths, Probably that second thing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Simplicty with Depth</strong> - The orders you can give are simple - the strategies you can achieve with them are surprisingly complex.<br></li><li><strong>Challenging Maps</strong> - As you loot your way through the galaxy, the different locations you explore will present unique tactical challenges for you to conquer via clever use of weapons, fortifications, and orders.<br></li><li><strong>Unique weapons</strong> - Penetrating Crossbows, Slashing Swords, Armour-piercing Snipers, Crushing Hammers, and many more weapon categories, each with multiple tiers and rarities.<br></li><li><strong>Super Time Stop Powers</strong> - Pause the game mid-combat to evaluate your strategy and give orders. It will help, but sometimes the bugs are just too much.<br></li><li><strong>Tough Decisions</strong> - comic book encounters at the start of each location will test your sanity. We recommend you don't look over the edge of the abyss.<br></li><li><strong>Danger Everywhere</strong> - Your crew are strong but can be quite fragile. Be careful not to let the bugs too close to them, or you may lose one. If they get knocked down too often, they won't stand back up!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Leaderboard!</strong> - reach the top 5 ranks on the leaderboard and be memorialized on the main menu for all to see!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278210/extras/endless_banner.gif?t=1711009689\" /></li></ul>",

Or else they'll all die horribly violent deaths, Probably that second thing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Simplicty with Depth</strong> - The orders you can give are simple - the strategies you can achieve with them are surprisingly complex.<br></li><li><strong>Challenging Maps</strong> - As you loot your way through the galaxy, the different locations you explore will present unique tactical challenges for you to conquer via clever use of weapons, fortifications, and orders.<br></li><li><strong>Unique weapons</strong> - Penetrating Crossbows, Slashing Swords, Armour-piercing Snipers, Crushing Hammers, and many more weapon categories, each with multiple tiers and rarities.<br></li><li><strong>Super Time Stop Powers</strong> - Pause the game mid-combat to evaluate your strategy and give orders. It will help, but sometimes the bugs are just too much.<br></li><li><strong>Tough Decisions</strong> - comic book encounters at the start of each location will test your sanity. We recommend you don't look over the edge of the abyss.<br></li><li><strong>Danger Everywhere</strong> - Your crew are strong but can be quite fragile. Be careful not to let the bugs too close to them, or you may lose one. If they get knocked down too often, they won't stand back up!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Leaderboard!</strong> - reach the top 5 ranks on the leaderboard and be memorialized on the main menu for all to see!<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1278210/extras/endless_banner.gif?t=1711009689\" /></li></ul>",

Beware of getting knocked into pits, lava, or toxic slime while taking every opportunity to give your opponents a friendly push.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Target selection is essential!

If the United States and Russia use nuclear weapons to attack each other without restriction, most creatures on the surface of the earth will die. Moreover, such deaths are not instantaneous, but last for many years. After the nuclear war, the earth will experience a 10-year nuclear winter. Because the nuclear war will cause 1.47 million tons of ash layer to diverge upwards, enter the stratosphere of the atmosphere, and then within a month, it will cover the entire sky above the earth, making it impossible for sunlight to reach the surface of the earth. The average temperature is less than 9 degrees, thus entering winter mode. Such a pattern will last for 7 years, and then the dust will gradually begin to dissipate, and the entire dissipating time will take as long as Su years, a total of 10 years. If you leave the sun for such a long time, the earth will be devastated. Therefore, no one can bear the price of unlimited use of nuclear weapons.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1409320/extras/1.png?t=1659101938\" /><br>\u3000\u3000 The earth has entered a 10-year dark winter, which is determined by physical principles. The power of a nuclear explosion is so great that it can roll up a lot of dust and make it enter the stratosphere of the atmosphere. The advection characteristics of the stratosphere determine that these dust will spread over the entire earth with the flow of the stratospheric atmosphere. The physical properties of dust determine that they are strong enough to block sunlight. A layer of dust on the outside will make the entire earth look like a thermal insulation suit. The sun\u2019s heat is difficult to enter, causing the earth\u2019s surface temperature to continue to drop, because according to common sense, everyone knows that the temperature at night will be higher than during the day because there is no sunlight.

Due to its small size and weight, the dust will flow for a long time in the stratosphere, so it will begin to dissipate after 7 years, and it will take 3 years to dissipate, so the earth will experience a 10-year nuclear winter.<br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1409320/extras/2.png?t=1659101938\" /><br>The outbreak of the nuclear war not only brought about a nuclear winter, but also turned most areas into contaminated areas of nuclear radiation, from the leakage of Chernobyl in Ukraine and the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan to the present decades or ten.

        "detailed_description": "In this single player campaign you'll play as a fairy named Gaia. It's your job to use element based attacks to defeat enemies as they try to drain the world of its color. Your abilities aren't only used for defeating enemies, you can also use them to solve puzzles and help you restore the color back in the world. You must seek out the mushrooms of life and restore their color thus restoring the color to that area.  Can you locate all of the mushrooms and save the world from becoming colorless?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND?</h2>Gaia, the soul of the world, rises from below the ground. Throughout time she has always taken on vastly different forms,  sometimes it was a destructive hurricane or beautiful rainbow after a gentle rainstorm. However, Gaia\u2019s world is in danger and almost devoid of color. So she decided to take on the form of a brushling, which is a powerful fairy. As she lies there after rising up from the ground she sees a single clumping of flowers starting to lose color and reaches for them to bring them back to life. The ground itself seems to remain unchanged for now, but the life from it has become colorless, despite the moon being changed to an eerie blue color. <br><br><br>As the once grey and beautiful moon moves over the landscape the evil Mageling uses it as a conduit to take the color out of the plants and objects. With Gaias uncanny ability to color the world around her, time is of the essence and the plants must be restored back to their original color before the moon does one full rotation. By restoring the color the real reason for the lack of color is revealed; The Shapelings are taking over, fueled by the Magelings colorless curse. Shapelings take on any form in their environment; they can hide in plain sight and are fierce, strong enemies, Gaia must traverse the landscape finding ways to change the colorless plants and objects back to their original color and defeat the Mageling and his minions before the moon's final rotation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONTROL THE ELEMENTS</h2>As you restore color to the world throughout your journey you'll unlock abilities that coordinate with the terrain you're in. You'll be able to control water, fire, lava, wind, ice, and more! These abilities will be used to help solve puzzles within the game and defeat enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A UNIQUE OPEN WORLD EXPERIENCE</h2>The world you'll play in is designed to be split up into sections separated by their elements. You'll travel through fire, water, ice, wind elements, and more! Explore this uniquely designed world and restore the beauty of it's color back to life.",

If that's what you fancy, then you're all set, but there are elements that give it an extra layer - a bonus for those who like to dig deeper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe puzzles themselves share some common principles, yet each has its own rules.

Realization of this fact already makes you worry about the heroes even more.\u201d<br>Gamer's Diary<br><br>\u201c&quot;Lurkers&quot; screams more than promise, it practically drags you into the world that Eddy lives in and his determination to seek justice for his mother. From the musical score that helped bring appropriate touches of suspense into the dialogue and the character designs, this story rich VN has made it onto my watch list.\u201d<br>Gray's Otome<br>",

The leadership bicker amongst themselves in a deadlock of conflicting solutions, until finally, they decide to call on Asgard for aid. Gunnhildr, the the only member of the Warrior class to become an Ancient, is sent to beg before the Gods, but they reject her. Unable to accept refusal, Gunnhildr challenges the Gods themselves in an effort to win their respect. She is defeated. The Gods spurn Niflheim as a parasite on the Nine Worlds, and shatter the Bifrost, isolating Niflheim from the other worlds of Yigdrasil forever. The Three Primes declare Gunnhildr to be &quot;The Damnation of Niflheim,&quot; and sentence her to an eternity in Niflhel. Her escape is where our story begins\u2026<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/Jotun.gif?t=1631131424\" /><br><br>As Gunnhildr, you'll embark on a journey across Niflheim through dynamically generated dungeons, with an arsenal of weapons and otherworldly powerups. Gather Halite crystals from fallen foes and scattered outcroppings to restore your shields; buy items for your survival; and keep your weapons cool. Listen to stories of old Niflheim in between battles as your benevolent guide, Lucky, helps you escape the dark chasms of Niflhel. Every run is different, every gun is upgradable, and everyone is waiting for you to free them from the Primes' grasp.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/bouncyGibs.gif?t=1631131424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fast-Paced First Person Combat</h2>Using your fists, grenades, and - of course - guns, travel through the realms of Niflheim and defeat the legions of the Primes. Gunnhildr features a vast collection of weaponry. As you venture deeper, you'll find individual powerups to boost their effectiveness or give them magical properties. You'll also find brand new weapons with powerups pre-applied. The choice is yours to switch over to the new gun or keep the one you've been working on.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/rocketsBoom.gif?t=1631131424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One Resource</h2>Halite powers everything. It is the source of life in Niflheim. You'll find Halite scattered around the world, and enemies will drop it when defeated. You'll use the Halite you collect to restore your shields, cool down your weapons, unlock treasures, and spend at the shop. When you die, you'll bring back most of the Halite you've collected in order to upgrade your abilities further at the Pensieve.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Narrative</h2>The lore of Niflheim is vast and Lucky knows it by heart. While you're busy scavenging for treasures and finding your way through Niflhel's labyrinths, Lucky will regale you with different legends from Niflheim's history. When the fighting picks up, he'll automatically cut himself off to let you focus on what you're doing. The storytelling structure builds context for the world and your actions as you build up your rebellion against the Primes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roguelooter</h2>Roguelite mechanics abound as you explore a randomized world with dozens of different rooms, dynamic weaponry, challenge rooms, resource management, and permadeath. New weapons and items drop constantly, giving you the chance to either juggle your loadout around or build up the one you've got.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Always Growing</h2>Gunnhildr is a living product. We're committed to growing the game throughout Early Access, adding new weapons, items, abilities, worlds, metagame features, and more as we move steadily toward launch.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/berserkerDefeated.gif?t=1631131424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join the Community</h2>Come chat with us here on Steam or join our Discord channel to watch us develop the game in real time!

Gunnhildr, the the only member of the Warrior class to become an Ancient, is sent to beg before the Gods, but they reject her. Unable to accept refusal, Gunnhildr challenges the Gods themselves in an effort to win their respect. She is defeated. The Gods spurn Niflheim as a parasite on the Nine Worlds, and shatter the Bifrost, isolating Niflheim from the other worlds of Yigdrasil forever. The Three Primes declare Gunnhildr to be &quot;The Damnation of Niflheim,&quot; and sentence her to an eternity in Niflhel. Her escape is where our story begins\u2026<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/Jotun.gif?t=1631131424\" /><br><br>As Gunnhildr, you'll embark on a journey across Niflheim through dynamically generated dungeons, with an arsenal of weapons and otherworldly powerups. Gather Halite crystals from fallen foes and scattered outcroppings to restore your shields; buy items for your survival; and keep your weapons cool. Listen to stories of old Niflheim in between battles as your benevolent guide, Lucky, helps you escape the dark chasms of Niflhel. Every run is different, every gun is upgradable, and everyone is waiting for you to free them from the Primes' grasp.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/bouncyGibs.gif?t=1631131424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fast-Paced First Person Combat</h2>Using your fists, grenades, and - of course - guns, travel through the realms of Niflheim and defeat the legions of the Primes. Gunnhildr features a vast collection of weaponry. As you venture deeper, you'll find individual powerups to boost their effectiveness or give them magical properties. You'll also find brand new weapons with powerups pre-applied. The choice is yours to switch over to the new gun or keep the one you've been working on.<br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/rocketsBoom.gif?t=1631131424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One Resource</h2>Halite powers everything. It is the source of life in Niflheim. You'll find Halite scattered around the world, and enemies will drop it when defeated. You'll use the Halite you collect to restore your shields, cool down your weapons, unlock treasures, and spend at the shop. When you die, you'll bring back most of the Halite you've collected in order to upgrade your abilities further at the Pensieve.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Narrative</h2>The lore of Niflheim is vast and Lucky knows it by heart. While you're busy scavenging for treasures and finding your way through Niflhel's labyrinths, Lucky will regale you with different legends from Niflheim's history. When the fighting picks up, he'll automatically cut himself off to let you focus on what you're doing. The storytelling structure builds context for the world and your actions as you build up your rebellion against the Primes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roguelooter</h2>Roguelite mechanics abound as you explore a randomized world with dozens of different rooms, dynamic weaponry, challenge rooms, resource management, and permadeath. New weapons and items drop constantly, giving you the chance to either juggle your loadout around or build up the one you've got.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Always Growing</h2>Gunnhildr is a living product. We're committed to growing the game throughout Early Access, adding new weapons, items, abilities, worlds, metagame features, and more as we move steadily toward launch.<br><br><br><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1377030/extras/berserkerDefeated.gif?t=1631131424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join the Community</h2>Come chat with us here on Steam or join our Discord channel to watch us develop the game in real time!
